# Time Series (Traffic Volume) Project
## Project Summary:
This project aims to forecast the traffic volume in Metro Interstate using time series analysis techniques. The dataset used in this project consists of hourly traffic volume data collected from a particular section of the interstate from 2012 to 2018.

To forecast the traffic volume for the next 8, 12 and 24 hours, we have used the ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model. ARIMA is a popular modeling technique used for time series forecasting that takes into account both the autoregressive (AR) and moving average (MA) components of the data.

The ARIMA model was trained on the historical traffic volume data, and the model parameters were optimized using the AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) and BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion) metrics. The model was then used to forecast the traffic volume for the next 8, 12 and 24 hours.

The results of the ARIMA model showed that it was able to accurately forecast the traffic volume for the next 8, 12 hours with low error metrics but with higher error with 24 hours. These results can be used by traffic management authorities to make informed decisions about traffic flow management, route optimization, and other related tasks.
